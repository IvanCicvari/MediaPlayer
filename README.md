Movie App
Welcome to the Movie App project! This project serves as a platform for me to enhance my skills in Python and React. As the project evolves, it will be further configured for Jenkins, Docker, and automation testing. The ultimate goal is to showcase my skill sets to potential employers or collaborators.

Project Overview
The Movie App project is designed to be a learning ground for Python and React development. Here are the key components:

Python Backend:

The backend of the application is developed using Python, focusing on backend logic, data processing, and server-side functionalities.
React Frontend:

The frontend is built with React, emphasizing a modern and responsive user interface. React is utilized for dynamic and interactive user experiences.
Future Enhancements
As the project progresses, the following features and configurations will be added:

Jenkins Integration:

Jenkins will be configured for continuous integration (CI), automating tasks such as building, testing, and deployment. This ensures a streamlined development process.
Docker Containerization:

Docker will be incorporated to containerize the application, providing a consistent and reproducible environment across different systems.
Automation Testing:

Automation testing frameworks will be implemented to ensure the reliability and stability of the application. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing.
Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in Python and React development, as well as my ability to implement industry-standard practices such as CI/CD, containerization, and automated testing.
